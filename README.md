# NYCDOE-Economic-Segregation-Project
A multiyear project that studies trends in Economic Segregation in NYC DOE and NYSED.


I had access to student level data and hence all references to data files have been replaced by data.csv. The processed data needed to build the scroller which is completely reworked and reanonimized is included in the scroller files.
