# NYCDOE-Economic-Segregation-Project
A multiyear project that studies trends in Economic Segregation in NYC DOE and NYSED.


I had access to student level data and hence all references to data files have been replaced by data.csv. The processed data needed to build the scroller which is completely re-worked and re-anonimized is included in the scroller files. 

The scroller.js code is heavily derived and the essentials of the code in sections.sam1.js code is somewhat derived from the works of :
