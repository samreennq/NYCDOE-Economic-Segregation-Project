                <h1>Within-School Segregation in a NYC DOE school</h1>

                    PS 33 in Manhattan is a racially diverse school, even more diverse than the New York City’s District 2, which it is a part of. At PS 33 in 2019-20, 28% of students were Hispanic or Latino, 24% of students were Asian, 21% of students were White, 17% of students were Black or African American, and 9% of students were from another racial or ethnic group or were multi-racial.<br><br>

                    In the graphic to the right, each circle represents one of the 88 first graders enrolled at PS 33 in 2019-20 (excluding five students who were in multi-grade special education classes). Like the school as a whole, the first grade at PS 33 was very diverse.

                However, when we sort students into their classes, we see substantial segregation by race. Two classes have mostly Black and Hispanic students, while two classes have mostly Asian and White students.

                    If we color code students based on their economic status, we see that most of the economically disadvantaged students are in the first two classes. The average student is in a class that is 34 percentage points away from the grade-wide average for percent economically disadvantaged.

                    Note: Economic status is based on the NYCDOE’s poverty flag.

                    If we were to randomly assign students to classes, we would expect a more even distribution of students by economic status. In this simulation, the average first grader is in a class that is 9.3 percentage points away from the grade-wide average for percent economically disadvantaged.

                In total, we ran 500 Monte Carlo simulations to randomly assign the students to the four classes, and the economic segregation index are shown in blue. The actual results for PS 33’s first grade in 2019-20 (shown in orange) are clearly the result of a non-random assignment of students to classes. In the case of PS 33, the school has two G&T classes in first grade.

                <h3>How common is within-school segregation?</h3>
                <p>Compared to elementary schools in the rest of the state, NYC elementary schools were more likely to show greater-than-expected within-school segregation. This was true across all categories we measured.
